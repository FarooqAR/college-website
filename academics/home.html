        The University of Pakistan teaches not what to think, but how. In an atmosphere of free and open inquiry, students and professors debate, collaborate, and investigate, challenging assumptions—and one another—with field-advancing insights backed by rigorous study. This unique education transforms individuals, preparing and empowering them to make a positive impact on the world.
